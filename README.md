# A* visualization by @emeuc3m
# Idea based on a video by youtube channel Tech With Team.

This project consists of a visualization on how the A* algorithm works.

Controls:
- First left click: set start point.
- Second left click: set goal.
- Third and left right clicks: set wall.
- Left click: set cell to empty.
- Spacebar: start visualization
- R: reset grid.
- T: generate random map.

Cells:

The white cells are empty cells that can be part of a path. 
The yellow cells are "slow" cells, it takes x3 the time to get through them than a white cell.
The black cells are walls that cannot be crossed.
